    description: "The Audi Q8 is the brand's first coupe-SUV and serves as its flagship SUV model. Built on the MLB Evo platform shared with the Q7, it features a more aggressive, sporty design with a sloping roofline, frameless doors, and distinctive styling elements including an octagonal single-frame grille. Despite the coupe-like design, the Q8 offers generous interior space for five passengers. The interior features Audi's latest technology with a dual-touchscreen MMI system and virtual cockpit digital instruments. Engine options include V6 and V8 TFSI petrol and TDI diesel units with mild-hybrid technology standard. The performance lineup includes the SQ8 with a powerful V8 engine and the RS Q8, which shares its twin-turbo V8 with the Lamborghini Urus, producing 591 HP and temporarily holding the SUV lap record at the NÃ¼rburgring. The Q8 combines the practicality of an SUV with coupe-like styling and sporty driving dynamics, positioned as a more emotional alternative to the Q7."
